# Qubits: Fractal Quantum Simulator

## Overview
The **Qubits** repository provides a framework for simulating **quantum-like systems** on classical hardware using fractal-inspired dynamics. This project explores the transition from chaotic, linear quantum states to stabilized, discrete structures through entropy-driven perturbations. The resulting visualizations demonstrate how quantum-like behavior can emerge and stabilize in classical systems.

## Key Features
- **Fractal Quantum State Simulation**: Dynamically evolves quantum states using fractal perturbations.
- **Entropy-Driven Stabilization**: Tracks entropy evolution as a mechanism for structural emergence.
- **Visualizations**: Animations of quantum state distribution and entropy stabilization.
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model**: Integrates neural networks with fractal dynamics for learning entropy patterns.

## Requirements
To run the simulator, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow 2.x

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow
```

## Code Structure
- `Fractal Quantum Simulator`:
  - Simulates complex quantum states (real and imaginary components).
  - Applies dynamic fractal perturbations to stabilize the states.
- **Entropy Computation**:
  - Calculates the entropy of quantum states over time to measure system order.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Shows the progression of quantum state distributions and entropy evolution.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RichardAragon/Qubits.git
   cd Qubits
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python fractal_qubit_model.py
   ```
3. Observe the output:
   - The **top visualization** shows the quantum state probability distribution transitioning from linear chaos to stabilized discrete states.
   - The **bottom visualization** tracks the entropy evolution as the system stabilizes.

## Output
- **Fractal Quantum State Distribution**:
  Visualizes how quantum states dynamically evolve under fractal perturbations.
- **Entropy Evolution**:
  Tracks the system's stabilization as entropy reduces over time.
